  caveats <<~EOS
    Fabre keeps operator configuration and persistent state in:
      ~/Library/Application Support/MidgardLabs/Fabre
    Fabre keeps logs in:
      ~/Library/Logs/MidgardLabs/Fabre

    Stop every running Fabre server before upgrading.
    A normal uninstall preserves these directories. Use --zap only when you
    intentionally want to remove all Fabre operator data.
